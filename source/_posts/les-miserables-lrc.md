Do you hear the people sing?

	Singing a song of angry men?

	It is the music of a people

	Who will not be slaves again!

	When the beating of your heart

	Echoes the beating of the drums

	There is a life about to start

	When tomorrow comes!

<!--more-->

	Will you join in our crusade?

	Who will be strong and stand with me?

	Beyond the barricade

	Is there a world you long to see?

	Then join in the fight

	That will give you the right to be free!

	Do you hear the people sing?

	Singing a song of angry men?

	It is the music of a people

	Who will not be slaves again!

	When the beating of your heart

	Echoes the beating of the drums

	There is a life about to start

	When tomorrow comes!

	Will you give all you can give

	So that our banner may advance

	Some will fall and some will live

	Will you stand up and take your chance?

	The blood of the martyrs

	Will water the meadows of France!

	Do you hear the people sing?

	Singing a song of angry men?

	It is the music of a people

	Who will not be slaves again!

	When the beating of your heart

	Echoes the beating of the drums

	There is a life about to start

	When tomorrow comes!
